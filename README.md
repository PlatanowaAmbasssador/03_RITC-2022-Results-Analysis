## Rotman International Trading Competition 2022 Results Analysis

## Description

### Aim
This project aims to analyse (perform an EDA) of the results of RITC 2022 to better understand the position of University of Warsaw, Faculty of Economic Sciences. Our code is (RZQ0). I have implemeneted an automated approach, where one can just add the data for any given year with the same trading case in order to generate the EDA report.

### Data
We use the data provided by Rotman for each Trading case.

## Project structure

- `01_Executor.ipynb` - defining parameters to generate the files for the EDA.
- `inputs` - input data file. One file with the results of trading cases.
- `outputs` - contains the .ipynb files generated after the generation of automated templates plus the hitml_outputs for each.
- `Templates` - used to generate the outputs for the given inputs. 
- `requirements.txt` - requirements file to run the code.
